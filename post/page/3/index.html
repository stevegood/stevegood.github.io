      <h2 class="title">Using Dropbox as a Distributed Backup</h2>
      <div class="summary">A while back I made some improvements to the backup scheme we use at KaiNexus. The requirements were pretty simple and straight forward. All our backups had to be encrypted, offsite and distributed. While there are a number of for-pay backup solutions out there we were looking for the bare minimum and free solution.
At the office, we all use Dropbox for file sharing so it seemed like a logical tool to use since we were all familiar with it.</div>

      <h2 class="title">Sanitizing Lists of Email Addresses</h2>
      <div class="summary">I ran across an exception today where an email address was not being validated on submit or server side. Obviously this is something that needs to be done, but what about when you have a list of email addresses? The app I&rsquo;m working on is old and lacks validation in most of the key areas. To combat this I created a method in a util object that will loop over a list of email addresses and validate each one by removing anything that does not match an email address structure.</div>

      <h2 class="title">Replace Linked MP3 Files with an Audio Player Using jQuery</h2>
      <div class="summary">A client of mine posts links to recorded audio files in a blog like structure. Linking to the files doesn&rsquo;t really create a great user experience and I decided to swap out the links with an embedded flash player to allow for instant playback while still providing a way for users to download the files.
I chose the popular WordPress Audio Player and jQuery to assist me with this. The jQuery code is pretty straight forward.</div>

      <h2 class="title">Using Groovy to write Atlassian plugins</h2>
      <div class="summary">Writing plugins for Atlassian products is pretty straight forward (once you get passed the insanely out-of-date documentation). But using Java can be overly verbose and less flexible than some other more modern languages. There are examples of writing plugins using Scala and JRuby out there but documentation for using Groovy seems to be a bit of a black hole. Since Groovy is my JVM language of choice, I have decided to document the process and give a simple example.</div>

      <h2 class="title">Moving to GitHub Pages</h2>
      <div class="summary">Ghost + Pivotal CF = &lt;3 Last year I moved my blog to Ghost and hosted it in Pivotal CF. This has been great so far but I&rsquo;m starting to get twitchy about paying for an application to be running in PCF when I rarely update anything. This is my response to that concern.
GitHub Pages There are a number of advantages to using GitHub Pages over a blogging application but for the most part I really like the price.</div>

      <div class="summary">I get asked all the time on my stream which language someone should learn when they first get started. I typically start by asking what the end goal is. Want to build games? Websites? Desktop applications? The answer to that question will lead new developers in totally different directions. I recently found a pretty good infographic to help young developers choose a language that best suites their goals.</div>

      <div class="summary">For the last two years I have been a full time contractor at KaiNexus serving as their Principal Architect. During this that time I made new friends and had the opportunity to work on a project that could leave a great positive mark on the world. However, as with all things, this chapter has come to a close. Starting this month I will be transitioning from KaiNexus to Cisco Systems.</div>

      <h2 class="title">Simple URL Monitor Using Groovy and Twilio</h2>
      <div class="summary">Recently, the need arose for me to monitor a URL so that notifications could be sent out if the site was suddenly unavailable. Later on down the road this will need to evolve into a more proactive system rather than reactive but for now I am just focusing on site down notifications.
To start, I set some minimal requirements for myself.
 Needs to be easy to write, can&rsquo;t take more than an hour to build Needs to be easy to maintain, problems should be easy to find and fix Needs to be able to send SMS messages in case of outages Needs to be able to run standalone or on a server under cron  When looking at the requirements I had to think about what kind of scripting environment would be best served for the task.</div>

      <div class="summary">Sometimes it is so easy to ignore the things around us that we see on a daily basis. The subject of this photo was no exception. This is a walkway at the office complex where I work 5 days a week and I never once thought to bring my camera and shoot it. A few days ago I decided to change that. Here are the results.

      <div class="summary">There is a really interesting hallway at UT Southwestern Medical Center that just screamed &ldquo;spooky&rdquo; at me. I wanted to grab my camera and shoot some of the interesting angles and lines but I was a bit worried about offending patients and staff by walking around the hotel with camera and tripod in hand. As an alternative, I used my iPhone and captured the following video. I processed it a little bit in iMovie.</div>

      <div class="summary">This is the finished product of the image below. It was taken in downtown Fort Worth on my last photowalk research day. I was fascinated by the combination of glass, metal and concrete and the lines they formed. Normally, this is filled with flowing water but I got there just shortly after they turned everything off. I really dig the way everything looks even without the water.

Brackets I saw a post on Google+ where someone posted a collage with the brackets used to make up one of their HDRs.</div>
