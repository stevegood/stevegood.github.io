      <description>There is a really interesting hallway at UT Southwestern Medical Center that just screamed &amp;ldquo;spooky&amp;rdquo; at me. I wanted to grab my camera and shoot some of the interesting angles and lines but I was a bit worried about offending patients and staff by walking around the hotel with camera and tripod in hand.

      <description>I am currently working through an older Cocoa book and learning how to develop apps for the Mac. While building the sample that demonstrates saving and opening files I noticed that my little application was already taking advantage of Lion&amp;rsquo;s new autosave and versions support. I recorded a quick video showing how easy it was to add this support.
