&lt;p&gt;There is a really interesting hallway at UT Southwestern Medical Center that just screamed &amp;ldquo;spooky&amp;rdquo; at me.  I wanted to grab my camera and shoot some of the interesting angles and lines but I was a bit worried about offending patients and staff by walking around the hotel with camera and tripod in hand.  As an alternative, I used my iPhone and captured the following video.  I processed it a little bit in iMovie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the last five days pretty much living at UT Southwestern Medical Center.  My step daughter has been unable to eat more than a few bites of food without throwing up for about three months.  After many tests and even a surgery to remove her gall bladder, doctors finally admitted her to the hospital for observation and even more tests.  As a result, my wife and I have spent nearly the whole time living I the hospital room with her.  I ask, for those comfortable with it, for prayers for her health and that the doctors would be able find the problem and come up with a solution.&lt;/p&gt;
