&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it is so easy to ignore the things around us that we see on a daily basis. The subject of this photo was no exception. This is a walkway at the office complex where I work 5 days a week and I never once thought to bring my camera and shoot it. A few days ago I decided to change that. Here are the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.stevegood.rocks/images/post/the-way-out.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.stevegood.rocks/images/post/the-way-out.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/images/post/the-way-out.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;smugmug-grails-plugin-update&#34;&gt;SmugMug Grails Plugin Update&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I mentioned that I was building a Grails plugin that aimed to wrap the SmugMug API. As of today, I am about 80% done with the coding and will be giving it a through test phase and creating docs soon.  Once done, it will be available through the normal Grails plugin channels and be completely open source.&lt;/p&gt;
