      <description>A while back I made some improvements to the backup scheme we use at KaiNexus. The requirements were pretty simple and straight forward. All our backups had to be encrypted, offsite and distributed. While there are a number of for-pay backup solutions out there we were looking for the bare minimum and free solution.
At the office, we all use Dropbox for file sharing so it seemed like a logical tool to use since we were all familiar with it.</description>
