      <description>I ran across an exception today where an email address was not being validated on submit or server side. Obviously this is something that needs to be done, but what about when you have a list of email addresses? The app I&amp;rsquo;m working on is old and lacks validation in most of the key areas. To combat this I created a method in a util object that will loop over a list of email addresses and validate each one by removing anything that does not match an email address structure.</description>
