## Grunge + Portraits = Hours of Fun

I started messing around with some techniques to add a feeling of grunge to a couple of the portraits in my library (nothing worth sharing yet) and found that I can't get enough. I found a pretty good, if not fast, tutorial (below) on the basics of applying grunge to a photo. One thing to note, I don't have [one of the plugins](http://www.niksoftware.com/silverefexpro/usa/entry.php "Silver Efex Pro") this video uses but I was able to get the same effect by creating a new layer and desaurating it completely and messing around with the levels, curves and exposure.  It's not as easy as the plugin filters but it costs way less.

## The Milk Silo

I stopped on my way home from the office about a week ago and took a few shots of a park that I pass everyday. It is amazing how many power lines and other modern things there are in almost every frame I want to capture.  This was one of those rare shots where I was able to avoid the power lines and hide the pesky water towers and street lights. All-in-all, I like the final result.
