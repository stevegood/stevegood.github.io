A while back I made some improvements to the backup scheme we use at [KaiNexus](http://kainexus.com/). The requirements were pretty simple and straight forward. All our backups had to be encrypted, offsite and distributed. While there are a number of for-pay backup solutions out there we were looking for the bare minimum and free solution.

At the office, we all use [Dropbox](http://db.tt/JbuaZVj) for file sharing so it seemed like a logical tool to use since we were all familiar with it. Dropbox lets us check off two requirements by being both off site and distributed. Here's my step-by-step guide on getting Dropbox setup on an Ubuntu server with minimal effort. I'm not covering the file encryption bit in this post but if you want to know how I did it let me know and I'll do a writup on it.

The steps outlined here were put together after reading through a couple of [other](http://welcometoubuntu.blogspot.com/2010/05/howto-install-python-255-on-ubuntu-1004.html) [guides](http://wiki.dropbox.com/TipsAndTricks/UbuntuServerInstall). Feel free to read those guides if you want but you should be able to get everything you need from what I have below.

## Install Python

1. Install build-essentials and gcc

        sudo apt-get install build-essential gcc

2. Download Python 2.5.5 (This seems to be the officially supported version)

        wget http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.5.5/Python-2.5.5.tgz

3. Extract

        tar -xvzf Python-2.5.5.tgz

4. Compile and install

        cd Python-2.5.5
        ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/python2.5
        make
        sudo make install
        sudo ln -s /usr/local/python2.5/bin/python /usr/bin/python2.5

## Install Dropbox

1. Switch to root user

        sudo -s

2. Create dropbox user and group and set the user's home to be** ```/etc/dropbox```

        groupadd dropbox
        useradd -r -d /etc/dropbox -g dropbox -s /bin/false dropbox

3. Download the 64-bit Dropbox binary

        wget -O /tmp/dropbox.tar.gz http://www.dropbox.com/download/?plat=lnx.x86_64

4. Create the dropbox user's home and set the ownership and permissions

        mkdir -p /usr/local/dropbox /etc/dropbox
        chown dropbox.dropbox /etc/dropbox
        chmod 700 /etc/dropbox

5. Extract the dropbox binaries

        tar xvzf /tmp/dropbox.tar.gz -C /usr/local/dropbox --strip 1

6. Remove the dropbox archive

        rm /tmp/dropbox.tar.gz

7. Switch to the dropbox user

        su -l dropbox -s /bin/bash

8. Set the user's permissions

        umask 0027

9. Execute the dropbox daemon _(Note: A URL will be repeated in the terminal window if the install machine is not registered to an account. Navigate to the URL (while logged in under the account you wish to link) and wait for the prompt to notify you that you are now linked. You'll get a simple welcome message.)_

		/usr/local/dropbox/dropboxd

10. Terminate the dropbox daemon with ```ctrl+c```
11. Log out of the dropbox user

        exit

12. Create the control script

        cat >> EOF | sed -e "s,%,$,g" &gt;/etc/init.d/dropbox
        ### BEGIN INIT INFO
        # Provides:          dropbox
        # Required-Start:    $local_fs
        # Required-Stop:     $local_fs
        # Default-Start:     2 3 4 5
        # Default-Stop:      0 1 6
        # Short-Description: starts the dropbox service
        # Description:       starts dropbox using start-stop-daemon
        ### END INIT INFO

        DROPBOX_USERS="dropbox"
        DAEMON=/usr/local/dropbox/dropbox
        unset DISPLAY

        start() {
            echo "Starting dropbox..."
            for dbuser in %DROPBOX_USERS; do
                HOMEDIR=%(getent passwd %dbuser | cut -d: -f6)
                if [ -x %DAEMON ]; then
                    HOME="%HOMEDIR" start-stop-daemon -b -o -c %dbuser -S -u %dbuser -x %DAEMON
                fi
            done
        }

        stop() {
            echo "Stopping dropbox..."
            for dbuser in %DROPBOX_USERS; do
                HOMEDIR=%(getent passwd %dbuser | cut -d: -f6)
                if [ -x %DAEMON ]; then
                    start-stop-daemon -o -c %dbuser -K -u %dbuser -x %DAEMON
                fi
            done
        }

        status() {
            for dbuser in %DROPBOX_USERS; do
                dbpid=%(pgrep -u %dbuser dropbox)
                if [ -z %dbpid ] ; then
                    echo "dropboxd for USER %dbuser: not running."
                else
                    echo "dropboxd for USER %dbuser: running (pid %dbpid)"
                fi
            done
        }


        case "%1" in
          start)
            start
            sleep 1
            status
            ;;

          stop)
            stop
            sleep 1
            status
            ;;

          restart|reload|force-reload)
            stop
            start
            sleep 1
            status
            ;;

          status)
            status
            ;;

          *)
            echo "Usage: /etc/init.d/dropbox {start|stop|reload|force-reload|restart|status}"
            exit 1

        esac

        exit 0
        EOF

13. Allow the control script to me executed and set it to autostart

        chmod a+x /etc/init.d/dropbox
        update-rc.d dropbox defaults

14. Start dropbox

        /etc/init.d/dropbox start

You should now have Dropbox running as a service on your server. All that's left is to create your cron jobs that run your backup scripts and have those backup files placed into the /etc/dropbox/Dropbox folder.
